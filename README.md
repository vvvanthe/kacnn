# Kolmogorov-Arnold Convolutional Neural Network

This repository contains an implementation of Kolmogorov-Arnold Convolutional Neural Network (KACNN). 

## Description

We proposed a kernel of B_spline function matrix instead of a real number matrix in conventional CNN. Additionally, some modification is needed to adapted into convolution function.

With 69K number of parameters, the performance in MNIST dataset is 98.4%.


## Note
This is just simple implementation, I am glad to receive any constructive comment.
